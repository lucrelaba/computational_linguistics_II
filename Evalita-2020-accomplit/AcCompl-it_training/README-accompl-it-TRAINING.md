==== Training Data - AcCompl-it @ EVALITA 2020 ====

This folder contains the training data for the Acceptability & Complexity evaluation task for Italian (AcCompl-it) shared task at EVALITA 2020. 

Two training datasets are included:

1) ACCEPT-Corpus-training: collection of sentences rated with human judgments about their degree of perceived acceptability, ranging on a 1-7 Likert scale, collected through crowdsourcing platforms, for a total of 1,339 sentences;

2) COMPL-Corpus-training: collection of sentences rated with human judgments about their degree of perceived complexity, ranging on a 1-7 Likert scale, collected through crowdsourcing platforms, for a total of 2,012 sentences.

In both corpora, sentences marked with AC-CO-* id are shared by the two corpora, since they have been judged both for acceptability and complexity.

-- FORMAT --
Each corpus has a `.tsv` format and contains the following information:

1) id: sentence id

2) N: number of human scores associated with the sentence

3) mean: mean value of human scores associated with the sentence, ranging on a 1-7 Likert scale

4) sd: standard deviation of the collected human scores

5) se: standard error of the collected human scores

6) sentence: text of the sentence

7) task: type of prediction task, i.e. acceptability or complexity prediction

8) reference: reference to previous studies concerned with the sentence or source partition of the Italian Universal Dependency Treebank from which the sentence was extracted
